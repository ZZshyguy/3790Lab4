Lab assignment 4

This is the pthreads half of it.

To run type:
make
then:
./threadfun <int> <int>

Where the first int is the number of threads you want and the second is the prime you want to search towards.
This program has no error checking for negative numbers or non integers so don't screw up the inputs.
